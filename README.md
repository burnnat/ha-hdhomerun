Custom component to enable [HDHomeRun](https://www.silicondust.com/hdhomerun/) integration for Home Assistant.

Creates an entity for each tuner found and attributes for signal_strength, SNR and CPS for the currently tuned to channel.
Useful for monitoring your antenna system; signal_strength and SNR should be good indicators that antenna, cabling, preamp and splitters are all in order.

See overview and configuration information [here](info.md).
